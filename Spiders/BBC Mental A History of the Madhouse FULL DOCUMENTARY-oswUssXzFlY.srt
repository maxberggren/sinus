it was a moment in history that changed
Britain's

18
00:01:04,88 --> 00:01:09,65
this is the story of the closing at the
Asylum's the often troubled lives they

despite the vast majority of patients
having committed no offence

101
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,669
life in the silence was dominated by
security the words were not open

to let the patient out and then close

century

110
00:07:26,9 --> 00:07:33,9
the change was on its way what

111
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:40,11
this leaflet

112
00:07:40,11 --> 00:07:43,889
is coming through your letterbox one day
soon read it

113
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,039
calf when the labor government created
the National Health Service in 1948

114
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,02
mental institutions were entirely
separate from general hospitals

115
00:07:53,02 --> 00:07:58,37
you'd before the NHS was created there
was some debate as to whether or not

116
00:07:58,37 --> 00:08:02,58
the Asylum's country would be included
in the National Health Service

117
00:08:02,58 --> 00:08:05,96
and it was decided finally did it would
be included

118
00:08:05,96 --> 00:08:09,539
and by including it I think it did
helped to

119
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:14,02
to bring the systems together hospitals
specialist services

120
00:08:14,02 --> 00:08:18,49
medicines it was the parting of ways
with the old pool

121
00:08:18,49 --> 00:08:22,969
etiology national a dementia patient was
being embraced by

122
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,969
the NHS a sauce the whole idea from the
quality of membership

123
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,579
while medical science has advanced
rapidly in the years before the creation

124
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:36,8
of the NHS

125
00:08:36,8 --> 00:08:40,169
therapy for mental illness was still
very limited

126
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,35
but now psychiatrists began to
experiment with new ideas

127
00:08:44,35 --> 00:08:48,3
and new treatments you get an increasing

128
00:08:48,3 --> 00:08:52,43
view that mental illness is really the
same as other physical illnesses and can

129
00:08:52,43 --> 00:08:54,699
be treated using the same sort it means

130
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,699
using physical interventions that work
on the body

131
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,899
one of these relatively new treatments
was the controversial

132
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,379
electroconvulsive therapy or ECT

133
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:10,23
it meant putting an electrical current
through the brain to induce a seizure

134
00:09:10,23 --> 00:09:14,92
it seems ease the symptoms are severe
depression in some patients

135
00:09:14,92 --> 00:09:18,62
though psychiatrists could not explain
how it worked

136
00:09:18,62 --> 00:09:22,069
Boulevard here in here

137
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,819
and then research and then your carried
your face

138
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:31,47
have epileptic fit whole

139
00:09:31,47 --> 00:09:35,79
ECT units were set up so that patients
can be treated in large numbers

140
00:09:35,79 --> 00:09:39,86
until the early nineteen fifties the
procedure was carried out largely

141
00:09:39,86 --> 00:09:40,87
without

142
00:09:40,87 --> 00:09:44,68
anesthetic a member of staff would lean

143
00:09:44,68 --> 00:09:47,899
heavily on the need another one at the
ankles and on

144
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:51,66
at each side hole in the shoulders down
and the consultant

145
00:09:51,66 --> 00:09:58,11
applied electrical charge through the
brain the patient of course jerked very

146
00:09:58,11 --> 00:09:58,86
very

147
00:09:58,86 --> 00:10:02,639
Thailand leak that's why we were holding
him down

148
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,3
because it had been known that this
pretty you could cause crashes and had

149
00:10:06,3 --> 00:10:07,22
cartridges

150
00:10:07,22 --> 00:10:10,68
ok despite appearances

151
00:10:10,68 --> 00:10:15,639
ECT was regarded as a step forward it
seemed to offer some patients a real

152
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,089
hope for improvement

153
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,48
your insulin doses

154
00:10:20,48 --> 00:10:25,54
are being prepared and checked another
the so-called shock treatments was

155
00:10:25,54 --> 00:10:30,709
incident therapy where doctors induced
coma by injecting large doses of insulin

156
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,829
into the body insulin coma treatment to
give it its full title

157
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,92
offers the greatest likelihood of relief
and Kira

158
00:10:37,92 --> 00:10:41,54
ha some patients whose illness is a
deep-seated nature

159
00:10:41,54 --> 00:10:44,809
she said H&amp;M yeah

160
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,449
at 10 I have a nice to have you seven
patients J

161
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,5
carol Wright injure homemade they would
speaking of which I have been

162
00:10:53,5 --> 00:10:58,74
actually it made him feel Priya it would
burn a Polish should be a

163
00:10:58,74 --> 00:11:02,74
in that body and drop the blood sugar
level very very low

164
00:11:02,74 --> 00:11:06,649
and to into coma and that was supposed
to be

165
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,139
beneficial and some way to the brain in
this condition

166
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,639
the mine has a chance to be completely
relaxed and the functions of the brain

167
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,939
have the opportunity

168
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:20,529
are as it were setting out on a new
power when consciousness returns

169
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,98
physical treatments like this advance
the image of psychiatry as a faster than

170
00:11:25,98 --> 00:11:28,199
typing scientific branch of medicine

171
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,089
in reality insulin proved

172
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,41
harmful medical failure forty-four
people were killed from its affects

173
00:11:36,41 --> 00:11:37,54
during this period

174
00:11:37,54 --> 00:11:43,579
may be bad Neeb effect and I had

175
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:48,089
January we can't give you any more
incident this is affecting you baby have

176
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:48,709
a pic

177
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:54,199
but one former treatment was more
drastic than all the others

178
00:11:54,199 --> 00:12:00,36
the lobotomy

179
00:12:00,36 --> 00:12:04,399
some psychiatrists believe that by
removing sections of the brain itself

180
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,98
certain serious mental disorders could
be permanently treated

181
00:12:09,98 --> 00:12:14,519
at least 15,000 these operations known
as prefrontal economies

182
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,49
were performed in Britain leaders also

refine the sexy where the cut through

that you could see the actual didn't

191
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,3
to pound away and an instrument had been
put in

192
00:12:56,3 --> 00:12:59,36
11 is it had been that hasn't been left
alone

193
00:12:59,36 --> 00:13:02,55
I heard them misfortune came over in a

00:13:02,55 --> 00:13:07,629
in all sixty whom sixty

patience who had the operation

196
00:13:10,92 --> 00:13:14,68
and the go through

197
00:13:14,68 --> 00:13:18,35
the one of them was a little

personal to change towards the end of
the nineteen fifties

200
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:35,139
this crude form of prefrontal equal to
me was phased out

201
00:13:38,91 --> 00:13:43,53
little was then known about the workings
of the brain for most patients there was

202
00:13:43,53 --> 00:13:46,4
no alternative to long periods in an
asylum

203
00:13:46,4 --> 00:13:49,59
they will voluble people and the public

204
00:13:49,59 --> 00:13:56,59
wasn't interested it could be a recipe
for abuse

205
00:14:00,81 --> 00:14:04,04
David McCarthy began his career as a
psychiatric nurse

206
00:14:04,04 --> 00:14:08,11
in 1957 at san Nicolas hospital near
Newcastle

207
00:14:08,11 --> 00:14:11,69
he was shocked by the treatment
routinely handed out to long-stay

208
00:14:11,69 --> 00:14:12,64
patients

209
00:14:12,64 --> 00:14:16,25
the first time was on the first day on
the 1st ward

210
00:14:16,25 --> 00:14:20,92
and I worked on well and the charge
nurse that was showing me around

211
00:14:20,92 --> 00:14:25,37
smacked a no or little old blind man
across the back of the head

212
00:14:25,37 --> 00:14:29,23
so fiercely that the flu across the room
unhittable

213
00:14:29,23 --> 00:14:35,34
I was very shocked because

214
00:14:35,34 --> 00:14:38,48
the charge nurse had been quite nice to
me when I came on the ward

215
00:14:38,48 --> 00:14:42,03
and hand 100 I was a bit lost for words
and he said

216
00:14:42,03 --> 00:14:46,01
dem don't you know if you live along
shit you become shared

217
00:14:46,01 --> 00:14:51,49
theme this kinda brutality was
considered almost inevitable for some

218
00:14:51,49 --> 00:14:54,17
other categories at the many ppl

219
00:14:54,17 --> 00:14:57,92
on the ward for a difficult patient
dimick's colleagues called the stuff for

220
00:14:57,92 --> 00:14:58,53
page

221
00:14:58,53 --> 00:15:01,88
some therapy the patient had been

222
00:15:01,88 --> 00:15:05,89
I'm active rather histrionic Lee sliding
office chair

223
00:15:05,89 --> 00:15:09,08
onto the floor and this was during the

224
00:15:09,08 --> 00:15:12,11
the unofficial stop breast time at
dinner time

225
00:15:12,11 --> 00:15:16,74
potentially the charge nurse at the
world

00:15:16,74 --> 00:15:20,79
got sick at tennis disappeared into the
target area

227
00:15:20,79 --> 00:15:25,18
he came out with the numbers look good
for the cold water

228
00:15:25,18 --> 00:15:28,54
I'm through it

229
00:15:28,54 --> 00:15:32,11
moreover the patient in the dayroom mom
everyone to see

230
00:15:32,11 --> 00:15:36,4
that alarmed about that over the top in
the patient's head

231
00:15:36,4 --> 00:15:40,42
and within a few seconds a patient and
slid back on the floor again

232
00:15:40,42 --> 00:15:44,47
so he called a staff nurse and they
dragged in by scholar

233
00:15:44,47 --> 00:15:50,06
crossed low into the bathroom area the
latest shouted from me

234
00:15:50,06 --> 00:15:53,45
and I went in and they were holding him
under

235
00:15:53,45 --> 00:15:57,3
the water in the bath bring them up

236
00:15:57,3 --> 00:16:02,24
and pushing under

237
00:16:02,24 --> 00:16:05,55
when they stopped Derek had to drive the
patient of

238
00:16:05,55 --> 00:16:09,74
I wanted to charge nurse who is in the
office and said

239
00:16:09,74 --> 00:16:12,889
is completely dry down to put new
clothes on and

240
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,92
can I have the key to get the shocks in
issue centered

241
00:16:15,92 --> 00:16:19,459
and he said to me what do you think this
is

242
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:26,18
brooklyn's send him out has he is

243
00:16:26,18 --> 00:16:30,35
there was no evidence have this kind of
treatment at high rates but

244
00:16:30,35 --> 00:16:33,95
investigations in subsequent decades
revealed persistent abuse

245
00:16:33,95 --> 00:16:39,19
other side limbs I'm convinced it was
endemic and in fact

246
00:16:39,19 --> 00:16:42,68
enquiries later on proved at the same
things were going on

247
00:16:42,68 --> 00:16:47,41
in other male cites a mental hospitals
right throughout the country

248
00:16:47,41 --> 00:16:51,47
by the mid-nineteen fifties

249
00:16:51,47 --> 00:16:55,19
almost home of the New NHS's beds were
given over to mental illness

250
00:16:55,19 --> 00:16:58,62
or mental disability and the cost was
mounting

251
00:16:58,62 --> 00:17:04,23
hope came from Liberty Reserve
scientists working on a new generation

252
00:17:04,23 --> 00:17:10,54
of drugs

253
00:17:10,54 --> 00:17:14,13
French psychiatrist started to use a
drug called cruel primacy

254
00:17:14,13 --> 00:17:17,86
which proved to be very effective in
calming psychotic patients

255
00:17:17,86 --> 00:17:21,27
within a few years log Axtell

256
00:17:21,27 --> 00:17:28,27
as it came to be called here had spread
right across Europe and America

257
00:17:32,36 --> 00:17:35,63
it was the first in a new range drugs an
important

258
00:17:35,63 --> 00:17:38,93
the will to revolutionize the way mental
illness could be treated

259
00:17:38,93 --> 00:17:43,12
these drugs promised ended the lock
doors anime boys

260
00:17:43,12 --> 00:17:50,12
and ultimately ended the asylum system
itself

261
00:17:51,95 --> 00:17:53,36
it was quite exciting

262
00:17:53,36 --> 00:17:57,149
you know this was something new and we
ask you wouldn't know it is really hard

263
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,299
to get involved in it

264
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,399
it was a turning point

265
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:05,679
some psychiatrists felt that the new
drugs had solved the riddle a mental

266
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,37
illness

267
00:18:06,37 --> 00:18:10,73
trouble losing the this into the pros

268
00:18:10,73 --> 00:18:14,62
others hey you as well

269
00:18:14,62 --> 00:18:19,789
unbearable which it isn't booked till

270
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:25,309
your optimism is quite important
produced

271
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,82
so Kairos will euros

272
00:18:28,82 --> 00:18:35,82
the new spirit of optimism was felt
keenly and highlights

273
00:18:40, --> 00:18:44,7
doctors here became pioneers at the new
drugs research

274
00:18:44,7 --> 00:18:47,899
much to the benefit to the silence green
in each

275
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:51,639
in Chad pity

276
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,019
formidable reputation you know in the
same state

277
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,58
he too is run in some respects like a

278
00:18:58,58 --> 00:19:02,269
fishing and there was a keen desire

279
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:05,98
in the early fifties to change its image

280
00:19:05,98 --> 00:19:11,179
for the better doctor Roy Hollins
started his career

281
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,539
as a biochemist he was invited to higher
rates and given his and stuff to

282
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,6
research the effective the truck lithium

283
00:19:18,6 --> 00:19:24,009
on the brain chemistry patients I want
to do

284
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:27,279
time came in from work on patients on

285
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,529
and manic-depressive the nation's mine
got some useful results

286
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,57
who your ID laws tune

287
00:19:34,57 --> 00:19:37,779
to Obama's work went into the patient

288
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:44,779
and measure what came out doctor Hollins
research proved a vital step in

289
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,12
establishing lithium

290
00:19:46,12 --> 00:19:50,82
as one of the most prominent need ranks
it is still widely used today

291
00:19:50,82 --> 00:19:57,71
as a treatment

292
00:19:57,71 --> 00:20:01,42
arrange new drugs ING's during the
nineteen fifties and sixties

293
00:20:01,42 --> 00:20:06,69
but they're not just new there is a
whole new idea about them in a new idea

294
00:20:06,69 --> 00:20:10,37
is that they all specific treatments for
specific disorders

295
00:20:10,37 --> 00:20:14,35
said that rather than just being
substances that drug people contain

296
00:20:14,35 --> 00:20:15,86
people said eight people

297
00:20:15,86 --> 00:20:20,49
which is what was thought about the old
drugs they all seem to be substances

298
00:20:20,49 --> 00:20:21,4
that somehow

299
00:20:21,4 --> 00:20:24,63
work on the underlying physical basis of
mental disorder

300
00:20:24,63 --> 00:20:30,23
it may have looked and felt like an old
Victorian asylum

301
00:20:30,23 --> 00:20:33,73
but I really it was now at the forefront
to the drugs revolution

302
00:20:33,73 --> 00:20:37,66
it was acknowledged as a research center
for mental illness

303
00:20:37,66 --> 00:20:44,66
and its medical staff presented their
findings all over the world

304
00:20:47,03 --> 00:20:48,53
the new wonder drugs

305
00:20:48,53 --> 00:20:53,25
created hope for the future but even
before they arrived some enlightened

306
00:20:53,25 --> 00:20:54,29
psychiatrists

307
00:20:54,29 --> 00:21:01,29
had started to develop a more humane
approach to cams

308
00:21:02,66 --> 00:21:04,28
the first thing we do

309
00:21:04,28 --> 00:21:07,31
a powerful improving the new moving

310
00:21:07,31 --> 00:21:10,32
and the decorations who plays

311
00:21:10,32 --> 00:21:14,21
walls to time occupation

312
00:21:14,21 --> 00:21:15,929
I'll

313
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:19,59
they were killed principal

314
00:21:19,59 --> 00:21:22,65
the employment news:

315
00:21:22,65 --> 00:21:28,1
the evil the num said the advances in
treatment

316
00:21:28,1 --> 00:21:31,46
some patients were now being given a new
program that activity

317
00:21:31,46 --> 00:21:35,909
of I'll

318
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,979
healing is the hallmark the hospital
these handcrafted one for money

319
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:45,869
a piece of homemade car or basket these
approved to these ladies

320
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,339
that they can still do some things as
well as anybody and even if the work is

321
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,359
slow and clumsy

322
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,82
it's better than berudi occupational
therapy this is called

323
00:21:55,82 --> 00:22:02,82
it serious scientific treatment but more
fundamental reforms were taking place

324
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,509
the first hospitals for now starting to
experiment with an

325
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,809
open-door policy something that would
have once been anathema to the ethos

326
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:15,289
of the asylum at one time

327
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:19,499
patients had nothing to do except to
walk around inside

328
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:24,749
and cokes now when the first things I
did was just sold on the ratings

329
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:28,269
there is news to a candle supports

330
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:31,859
to you that people come and go much from
3d

331
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,379
did the signs just physically was spruce
top

332
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:43,379
game declaration made more homely

333
00:22:46,58 --> 00:22:49,46
in the mid-nineteen fifties there were
over a hundred and fifty thousand

334
00:22:49,46 --> 00:22:50,679
patients

335
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,03
mental hospitals more than at any time
in history

336
00:22:54,03 --> 00:23:01,03
politicians from all parties agreed that
the asylum regime was very expensive its

337
00:23:02,11 --> 00:23:03,12
morality was now

338
00:23:03,12 --> 00:23:09,14
also being questioned in 1959 the
Conservative government passed a radical

339
00:23:09,14 --> 00:23:09,5
new

340
00:23:09,5 --> 00:23:13,37
active parliament introduced a more
compassionate approach to the treatment

341
00:23:13,37 --> 00:23:14,42
of the mentally

342
00:23:14,42 --> 00:23:18,02
in perhaps one of our greatest reforms

343
00:23:18,02 --> 00:23:22,45
is in the new Mental Health Act which
interprets in modern terms

344
00:23:22,45 --> 00:23:27,3
a new approach to mental sickness so
that it is no longer on illness with the

345
00:23:27,3 --> 00:23:27,94
stigma

346
00:23:27,94 --> 00:23:31,07
but one which should be treated with the
same sympathy

347
00:23:31,07 --> 00:23:35,
and understanding as any Obama physical
disability

348
00:23:35, --> 00:23:38,14
the nation's conscience have been
pricked

349
00:23:38,14 --> 00:23:41,179
Britain was coming face to face with its
asylums

350
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:45,9
which had quarantine the mentally ill
from society for over a hundred use

351
00:23:45,9 --> 00:23:51,25
you had to justify not locking the doors
but why you locking the doors

352
00:23:51,25 --> 00:23:54,8
it was that I wasn't accepted that you
simply love and that what he always done

353
00:23:54,8 --> 00:23:58,25
why a locking them why do these patients
have to be locked in

354
00:23:58,25 --> 00:24:01,8
the nineteen

355
00:24:01,8 --> 00:24:05,
59 act represented

356
00:24:05, --> 00:24:08,2
the final break with the Victorian
period

357
00:24:08,2 --> 00:24:11,45
to mister cheney point because it
recognized

358
00:24:11,45 --> 00:24:14,86
for the first time that Jim the mental
hospital

359
00:24:14,86 --> 00:24:18,77
and in the future was not necessarily
going to be the main

360
00:24:18,77 --> 00:24:22,61
lockerz have cash for people with mental
health problems

361
00:24:22,61 --> 00:24:28,47
the impetus for change was gaining
strength

362
00:24:28,47 --> 00:24:33,03
but it took a maverick politician to
grasp the vision of a nation without

363
00:24:33,03 --> 00:24:37,3
asylums enough panel shattered the sense
that the

364
00:24:37,3 --> 00:24:40,559
old mental institutions were shameful
relics of the past

365
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,46
in a prophetic speech in 1961

366
00:24:44,46 --> 00:24:47,65
he made a dramatic pledge to tear them
down

367
00:24:47,65 --> 00:24:52,31
mud I'm

368
00:24:52,31 --> 00:24:56,1
now look and see what are the
implications of these bold words

369
00:24:56,1 --> 00:25:00,73
0 they imply nothing less than the
elimination up by far the greater part

370
00:25:00,73 --> 00:25:02,79
of this country's mental hospitals

371
00:25:02,79 --> 00:25:06,61
as they exist today 0

372
00:25:06,61 --> 00:25:07,89
%uh

373
00:25:07,89 --> 00:25:12,96
it was a call to arms and Powell was
under no illusions about the strength of

374
00:25:12,96 --> 00:25:15,05
the likely opposition to his plans

375
00:25:15,05 --> 00:25:17,86
huh

376
00:25:17,86 --> 00:25:21,23
there they stand isolated majestic

377
00:25:21,23 --> 00:25:25,03
imperious brooded over by the gigantic
water tower

378
00:25:25,03 --> 00:25:30,35
and chimney combined rising unmistakable
and daunting out to the countryside

379
00:25:30,35 --> 00:25:34,169
the asylum switch our forefathers build
with such immense solidity

380
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,35
to express the nation's day 0

381
00:25:37,35 --> 00:25:40,59
do not for a moment underestimate powers
a resistance

382
00:25:40,59 --> 00:25:46,8
to holler sold homes mom

383
00:25:46,8 --> 00:25:49,92
the water tower became the defining
images speech

384
00:25:49,92 --> 00:25:53,39
I'll enough power was determined to
remove everything it stood for

385
00:25:53,39 --> 00:25:57,54
and replace it with a new model of care
based in the units have general

386
00:25:57,54 --> 00:25:58,28
hospitals

387
00:25:58,28 --> 00:26:02,76
and community I'll p.m. for told the end

388
00:26:02,76 --> 00:26:05,91
the mental hospital regimes at that time
they wear

389
00:26:05,91 --> 00:26:09,44
100 or so in this country in not had
closed

390
00:26:09,44 --> 00:26:12,86
none of them had any tension closing at
that time

391
00:26:12,86 --> 00:26:17,47
so this was a visionary speech the
church with looking beyond

392
00:26:17,47 --> 00:26:20,54
the current regime to a completely
different

393
00:26:20,54 --> 00:26:26,13
social landscape in it was a national
social conscience that was awakened

394
00:26:26,13 --> 00:26:33,13
and it was beginning of the end for
places like this

395
00:26:35,73 --> 00:26:39,179
enough power had to note that both new
plan to mental health

396
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,07
outside the SI rims that as he predicted

397
00:26:43,07 --> 00:26:47,35
it had little immediate impact on the
echoing words and endless corridors

398
00:26:47,35 --> 00:26:52,259
Britain's existing mental hospitals the
new here

399
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,789
altering the brain's chemical balance
remain focus

400
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:02,769
the new drugs which had initially held
out the promise of closing yes I did

401
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:09,769
now seemed to be doing the opposite in
the nineteen sixties there was a growing

402
00:27:10,45 --> 00:27:12,559
recognition that drugs might not be

403
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,74
ending the asylum culture but prolonging
it

404
00:27:15,74 --> 00:27:21,85
it

405
00:27:21,85 --> 00:27:24,3
the

406
00:27:24,3 --> 00:27:26,09
the

407
00:27:26,09 --> 00:27:31,43
a BBC documentary in 1969 found the
conditions with in mental hospitals

408
00:27:31,43 --> 00:27:38,43
was still disturbing ok

409
00:27:38,45 --> 00:27:40,41
the

410
00:27:40,41 --> 00:27:44,98
for many patients the tranquilizing
drugs well causing new problems

411
00:27:44,98 --> 00:27:51,58
ok they are basically sedative drugs but
they produce a very special sorted

412
00:27:51,58 --> 00:27:52,42
sedation

413
00:27:52,42 --> 00:27:56,72
which is a bit like having parkinson's
disease so that not only did they sedate

414
00:27:56,72 --> 00:27:58,27
she but they make you physically

415
00:27:58,27 --> 00:28:03,47
rigid and they they physically slow you
are and the men case very well

416
00:28:03,47 --> 00:28:06,9
to me or like the system came down on me
so

417
00:28:06,9 --> 00:28:09,99
heavily straightaway was just

418
00:28:09,99 --> 00:28:14,62
do you know as if things like dogs in
shock treatment was the answer to my own

419
00:28:14,62 --> 00:28:15,85
happiness or whatever

420
00:28:15,85 --> 00:28:22,85
which it certainly wasn't it made things
a lot worse

421
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,009
jeanne davison was brought up in a
working-class district to Bradford

422
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:34,74
at the end of the fifties

423
00:28:34,74 --> 00:28:40,27
very much expected me that I leave
school and go to work in a factory are

424
00:28:40,27 --> 00:28:43,27
some kind of data in Joplin at

425
00:28:43,27 --> 00:28:49,2
that firm was difficult because I found
it bother him

426
00:28:49,2 --> 00:28:52,78
in her teens she began to feel depressed
and alienated

427
00:28:52,78 --> 00:28:56,89
I was dissatisfied with my lifestyle

428
00:28:56,89 --> 00:29:00,58
and I suppose that in a way last the
stock to be

429
00:29:00,58 --> 00:29:04,21
they felt a feeling that I got that life
was empty and meaningless

430
00:29:04,21 --> 00:29:08,07
gene felt that she needed someone to
talk to

431
00:29:08,07 --> 00:29:11,309
she lost her GP

432
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,04
for an appointment with a psychiatrist
who recommended that she spent the week

433
00:29:15,04 --> 00:29:16,64
addressed an observation

434
00:29:16,64 --> 00:29:23,09
highlights her local mental hospital
right back from childhood

435
00:29:23,09 --> 00:29:27,64
so joked with all the kids saying will
take it away in a green BAM for higher

436
00:29:27,64 --> 00:29:28,92
energy know it was the

437
00:29:28,92 --> 00:29:35,39
mental hospital that we all knew about
the

438
00:29:35,39 --> 00:29:37,789
from

439
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:41,47
lot comes out in my mind was walk you
know

440
00:29:41,47 --> 00:29:44,69
the dry and getting the first glimpse at
the hospital

441
00:29:44,69 --> 00:29:48,97
in the thought of a BMI I think that
made it look maybe

442
00:29:48,97 --> 00:29:54,139
mom got they feel whatever the big
looming play through the clock tower and

443
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,45
a and I remember than thinking

444
00:29:56,45 --> 00:30:00,559
my goodness what a mother and myself in
power

445
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,1
Jean arrived on award when medical
confidence in the positive effects of

446
00:30:04,1 --> 00:30:04,72
drugs

447
00:30:04,72 --> 00:30:08,6
was at its height %uh morning after she
arrived she was given

448
00:30:08,6 --> 00:30:11,979
first taste blog acton

449
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,899
no wonder it not me out made me drowsy
because that's what ya got told those

450
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,359
it's a really strong

451
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:24,359
what the call anti-psychotic drug

452
00:30:26,3 --> 00:30:30,14
while heavily drugged jeanne was
persuaded to sign up to a course have an

453
00:30:30,14 --> 00:30:31,64
extra convulsive therapy

454
00:30:31,64 --> 00:30:37,399
ECT was routinely being carried out with
anesthetic

455
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,149
but the procedure was still terrifying
three teenagers

456
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:45,36
who'd had no previous contact with
psychiatry

457
00:30:45,36 --> 00:30:48,36
pick up any breakfast that morning on

458
00:30:48,36 --> 00:30:52,35
a small ambulance comes and picks up all
the patients on the way

459
00:30:52,35 --> 00:30:56,649
and took me to another part of the
building where the DC ten

460
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:01,46
given an injection in a damn

461
00:31:01,46 --> 00:31:04,799
this to dry you now apparently an

462
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,249
top she swallowing you tom was one says
when you have in effect

463
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:13,869
our ass scared yet I mean I'm even
scared and just up in an anesthetic from

464
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:15,389
stop them and the file

465
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:21,08
electric shocks going in tea brain the
came out with a hot water bottle

466
00:31:21,08 --> 00:31:25,08
and where to put it on the back about a
month about move aimed found out for the

467
00:31:25,08 --> 00:31:28,19
anesthetic injection

468
00:31:28,19 --> 00:31:31,23
and I remember feeling really powerless
lead amid

469
00:31:31,23 --> 00:31:36,67
back I mean this injection panicked and
wanted it all to stop by and try to

470
00:31:36,67 --> 00:31:43,67
a fight them to stop them doing it then
and

471
00:31:51,34 --> 00:31:54,81
good

472
00:31:54,81 --> 00:32:00,46
and then the next thing I remember is
I'm wakey not been really come field

473
00:32:00,46 --> 00:32:04,43
feel really disorientated its light
everything

474
00:32:04,43 --> 00:32:08,13
familiar but not quite right thumb I'll

475
00:32:08,13 --> 00:32:12,22
and the worst thing though I found was
he told that they might be tempting

476
00:32:12,22 --> 00:32:14,1
effects lot not but I

477
00:32:14,1 --> 00:32:17,44
saw what if what he's doing some
permanent damage

478
00:32:17,44 --> 00:32:21,05
to the brain this this that was horrible

479
00:32:21,05 --> 00:32:25,17
the

480
00:32:25,17 --> 00:32:28,2
what was initially supposed to be a week
observations gene

481
00:32:28,2 --> 00:32:32,37
became stay have several months on an
inpatient ward time rides

482
00:32:32,37 --> 00:32:36,35
ok this turned into five years today
patient

483
00:32:36,35 --> 00:32:41,34
by the end 18th out at the hospital
itself had become part of the problem

484
00:32:41,34 --> 00:32:46,68
not the solution I fell up just got
soaked in

485
00:32:46,68 --> 00:32:50,48
to going along with their noms Oh
whatever you known

486
00:32:50,48 --> 00:32:53,59
it's strange really is like a

487
00:32:53,59 --> 00:32:56,9
yeah a different world that use OnStar

488
00:32:56,9 --> 00:33:00,55
stop becoming a pot VR world in a way

489
00:33:00,55 --> 00:33:07,55
gene felt the ECT and the drugs were
actually contributing to her depression

490
00:33:08,79 --> 00:33:12,17
so she began secretly cutting back on
her dosage

491
00:33:12,17 --> 00:33:16,93
against the advice of highlights staff
it was an active rebellion

492
00:33:16,93 --> 00:33:22,18
with positive effect as I gradually cut
down

493
00:33:22,18 --> 00:33:26,64
are gradually got much much better all
these drowsiness depression lack of

494
00:33:26,64 --> 00:33:27,37
interest

495
00:33:27,37 --> 00:33:30,67
the last drugs I were on the mall that
started lifting

496
00:33:30,67 --> 00:33:34,67
the change was amazing without the drugs
I'd almost forgotten

497
00:33:34,67 --> 00:33:37,86
what it felt like to be awake and alive
the

498
00:33:37,86 --> 00:33:44,86
again not want that was love life that
was marvelous jeans resistance to her

499
00:33:45,61 --> 00:33:48,36
psychiatrist's was part of a wider
phenomenon

500
00:33:48,36 --> 00:33:51,64
too many patients doctors nurses and

501
00:33:51,64 --> 00:33:54,9
over-reliant on pills the new tools of
the trade

502
00:33:54,9 --> 00:34:01,51
they saw drugs being used as blunt
instruments

503
00:34:01,51 --> 00:34:07,63
in a way that was out of step with the
spirit at the time on

504
00:34:07,63 --> 00:34:13,639
firms Britain in the sixties was
undergoing enormous social changes

505
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,659
there was a new freedom to break down
barriers

506
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:21,649
can challenge orthodoxy on the drive to
close the silence captured this

507
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,169
rebellious mood

508
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:28,409
on mental hospitals were just another
battleground

509
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,95
in a power struggle establishment

510
00:34:33,95 --> 00:34:38,21
there are see a whole raft of civil
libertarian movement to get going

511
00:34:38,21 --> 00:34:42,409
ideas about what mentions really is and
how it should be treated

512
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:48,39
become ideas to social interest at the
forefront in his radical new thinking

513
00:34:48,39 --> 00:34:51,53
was the controversial psychiatrist are
delaying

514
00:34:51,53 --> 00:34:55,04
his books and speeches outlined a new
approach to treatment

515
00:34:55,04 --> 00:34:58,57
in which the patient not the doctor new
best

516
00:34:58,57 --> 00:35:02,48
they wish I wouldn't word got her true
/param arab girl

517
00:35:02,48 --> 00:35:05,9
are television earned air

518
00:35:05,9 --> 00:35:11,34
to the proper rap and this is exactly
why I think there any American who had

519
00:35:11,34 --> 00:35:13,28
great defense with a nerd

520
00:35:13,28 --> 00:35:19,01
particular repeated acted through his
books and ideas

521
00:35:19,01 --> 00:35:23,18
caused a sensation the general thesis is
a positive experiences

522
00:35:23,18 --> 00:35:27,62
thats we live in a mad world and a
normal response to a mad world is to be

523
00:35:27,62 --> 00:35:28,26
mad

524
00:35:28,26 --> 00:35:33,49
and that the that the sanity that most
has managed to maintain is actually

525
00:35:33,49 --> 00:35:40,49
two more abnormal sort of response but
many powerful mainstream psychiatrists

526
00:35:40,81 --> 00:35:42,08
working in the Asylum's

527
00:35:42,08 --> 00:35:47,26
closed ranks against the new ideas
blanks thinking was treated as

528
00:35:47,26 --> 00:35:48,03
peripheral

529
00:35:48,03 --> 00:35:53,46
meanwhile some doctors were seeking
progress and on experimental lines

530
00:35:53,46 --> 00:35:57,51
particularly in surgery I'm

531
00:35:57,51 --> 00:36:01,57
on and a minute ago slain 10

532
00:36:01,57 --> 00:36:06,84
psychiatrist at high rates so confident
about one pioneer in former

533
00:36:06,84 --> 00:36:10,34
brain operation that they gave
permission for a documentary crew

534
00:36:10,34 --> 00:36:16,24
to film it being carried out on one of
the patients the documentary focused on

535
00:36:16,24 --> 00:36:17,23
mickey Chapman

536
00:36:17,23 --> 00:36:21,09
who'd been admitted to highlight several
times as a patient during the early

537
00:36:21,09 --> 00:36:21,91

565
00:38:04,7 --> 00:38:08,03
spent in a mental hospital has gradually
going to go on increasing

566
00:38:08,03 --> 00:38:12,34

it forever balancing the risks

567
00:38:12,34 --> 00:38:15,9
with an operation a games the risks

to the patient did not doing the
impression an important

569
00:38:19,47 --> 00:38:23,95
it was terrifying surgery the doctors
regarded as a huge leap forward

570
00:38:23,95 --> 00:38:27,31
Maggie was taken from his side into the
local hospital

571
00:38:27,31 --> 00:38:30,77
there 29 on balls were fixed in her
forehead

572
00:38:30,77 --> 00:38:34,64
to act as guides for electrodes which
would pinpoint a crucial part of her

573
00:38:34,64 --> 00:38:35,25
brain

574
00:38:35,25 --> 00:38:38,58
the electrode is attached to the
electricity supply

575
00:38:38,58 --> 00:38:41,9
and the current is switched on
stimulating the area

576
00:38:41,9 --> 00:38:48,9
at the bottom of the electric home

577
00:38:49,15 --> 00:38:53,31
have to do more why did you have to do
that mom

578
00:38:53,31 --> 00:38:56,34

I'm pretty sure mmm

581
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,18
nice that made this decision made if a
motorbike

582
00:39:08,18 --> 00:39:11,95
pass me all some Listerine in the world

583
00:39:11,95 --> 00:39:16,01
it's like a hoe

584
00:39:16,01 --> 00:39:19,54
got I just touched down so everything
shakes and had

585
00:39:19,54 --> 00:39:23,89
keep looking I'm burn

586
00:39:23,89 --> 00:39:28,67
you have people thing I don't look up
when he got the response to fit in my

587
00:39:28,67 --> 00:39:29,28
eyes

588
00:39:29,28 --> 00:39:33,25
the pupils right capsized gun

589
00:39:33,25 --> 00:39:36,52
that's when you know that connected the
power

590
00:39:36,52 --> 00:39:43,33
I'm a brain and react to tear a new

591
00:39:43,33 --> 00:39:47,28
electrode is put in the correct position
and to this will be attached a much

592
00:39:47,28 --> 00:39:48,39
larger current

593
00:39:48,39 --> 00:39:55,39
which causes the tip of the electrode to
heat up district say

594
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,619
pro bomb and then peace map right now

595
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:04,81
maggie's doctors regard to the operation

596
00:40:04,81 --> 00:40:08,9
as a success it could at least get him
out at high rides

597
00:40:08,9 --> 00:40:12,16
but she insists the effects of the
surgery

598
00:40:12,16 --> 00:40:15,45
with debilitating I woulda

599
00:40:15,45 --> 00:40:20,15
is only for five years could communicate
with people when I like

600
00:40:20,15 --> 00:40:23,869
me speech income and the body

601
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:29,64
me but it was all one-way Mackey is now
successful campaigner for local

602
00:40:29,64 --> 00:40:30,859
community causes

603
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:35,27
she's adamant that she has put her life
together

604
00:40:35,27 --> 00:40:42,27
in spite of the operation not because it

605
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:49,96
her experiment treatment is now a piece
of surgical history

606
00:40:49,96 --> 00:40:53,5
maybe still bitterly regrets what was
done to her

607
00:40:53,5 --> 00:40:59,319
and how she was persuaded to consent to
it I don't think I needed that dream

608
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,599
and and I look at it this way right

609
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,01
there's more violence inflicted on me
that I have a

610
00:41:06,01 --> 00:41:13,01
inflicted on anybody that with GBH what
they did to my

611
00:41:13,15 --> 00:41:20,15
bring I'll never forgive and forget

612
00:41:33,62 --> 00:41:36,55
by the mid-70s in a panel had hoped that
many

613
00:41:36,55 --> 00:41:39,9
if not all the old mental institutions
would have disappeared

614
00:41:39,9 --> 00:41:46,38
but not a single asylum claims Britain
had entered a recession

615
00:41:46,38 --> 00:41:53,38
bringing drastic cuts in health spending

616
00:41:53,68 --> 00:41:56,349
members in the silence had to be reduced

617
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:01,19
at many hospitals the cul happened
gradually one more data timing

618
00:42:01,19 --> 00:42:04,579
up

619
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,559
it started in the early seventies when
award would be shut down

620
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,089
if a person died in that water a patient
with this

621
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,89
Josh in this world with physically
removed the bed so that nobody could be

622
00:42:15,89 --> 00:42:17,289
admitted into it again

623
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:23,219
if GP's wanted to refer a patient for
possible admission for observation

624
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,66
there wasn't a bed any longer people had
to be missed in the community had to be

625
00:42:27,66 --> 00:42:34,36
cared for in the community

626
00:42:34,36 --> 00:42:38,09
throughout the nineteen seventies almost
every asylum in Britain remained

627
00:42:38,09 --> 00:42:41,43
open but as individual award shut down

628
00:42:41,43 --> 00:42:45,78
many former patients were tipped onto
the streets to cope with life outside

629
00:42:45,78 --> 00:42:50,88
in the early nineteen eighties the BBC's
brass tax program

630
00:42:50,88 --> 00:42:54,06
found it was left to charities like the
Salvation Army

631
00:42:54,06 --> 00:43:01,06
to pick up the pieces the the I

632
00:43:06,3 --> 00:43:13,3
the sixty-five thousand beds in
long-stay wards have been phased out in

633
00:43:13,38 --> 00:43:14,28
20 years

634
00:43:14,28 --> 00:43:17,45
but the community care that was supposed
to take their place

635
00:43:17,45 --> 00:43:21,93
this case the materialized the long-term
mentally ill are still with us

636
00:43:21,93 --> 00:43:25,32
but now in many cases fending for
themselves I'm

637
00:43:25,32 --> 00:43:31,89
comfort you today and every day

638
00:43:31,89 --> 00:43:33,91
mine jumping migrant

639
00:43:33,91 --> 00:43:36,44
and darkness a schizophrenic

640
00:43:36,44 --> 00:43:42,43
and turn I then became revolving-door
patient

641
00:43:42,43 --> 00:43:45,66
cool

642
00:43:45,66 --> 00:43:49,589
telling I hospital in Sussex was home to
Andrew voice in various points in

643
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:50,42
seventies

644
00:43:50,42 --> 00:43:55,19
well he had had a nervous breakdown when
he was 23 me

645
00:43:55,19 --> 00:44:02,19
and ended up being committed been
discharged several times in well

646
00:44:03,05 --> 00:44:08,53
always never got wise by the oldest on
May showed

647
00:44:08,53 --> 00:44:12,49
they would give me medication by
injection by

648
00:44:12,49 --> 00:44:15,57
founder the talk of the side effect
colder

649
00:44:15,57 --> 00:44:20,609
acuff easier and a I went to be
extremely restless

650
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,69
bonds anticipation the same time

651
00:44:23,69 --> 00:44:27,73
for a week Diane night after the
injection

652
00:44:27,73 --> 00:44:32,67
it was number anybody experienced and

653
00:44:32,67 --> 00:44:35,81
and he was just anxious to avoid the
painful symptoms

654
00:44:35,81 --> 00:44:40,14
is the scion most to me mu

655
00:44:40,14 --> 00:44:43,09
like many others he was a victim in the
diminishing number

656
00:44:43,09 --> 00:44:47,16
the long-stay bed

657
00:44:47,16 --> 00:44:51,94
I would get paranoid I would be living
rough I wouldn't be looking after myself

658
00:44:51,94 --> 00:44:53,71
not been neglecting myself

659
00:44:53,71 --> 00:44:57,05
and I'll get return to use on immunity
by the police

660
00:44:57,05 --> 00:45:00,58
and that was the night you have more
revolving-door life

661
00:45:00,58 --> 00:45:05,51
and 10 got back into this on-again I
would stop in ejections again and

662
00:45:05,51 --> 00:45:08,94
they did this about 12 times between

663
00:45:08,94 --> 00:45:14,77
about 1975 and about 1990

664
00:45:14,77 --> 00:45:18,79
beyond the asylum walls many patients
find it was little organized K

665
00:45:18,79 --> 00:45:25,79
a new hope for secure life

666
00:45:36,9 --> 00:45:42,77
but there was no going back

667
00:45:42,77 --> 00:45:46,16
in the nineteen eighties the signs
finally began to close

668
00:45:46,16 --> 00:45:52,04
revolution in life

669
00:45:52,04 --> 00:45:58,56
swiftly with the momentum the victim

670
00:45:58,56 --> 00:46:05,56
by nineteen ninety 200,000 patients have
been discharged into wider society

671
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:07,61
0

672
00:46:07,61 --> 00:46:12,9
history is taking its revenge on the
institutions

673
00:46:12,9 --> 00:46:19,37
the mental hospital is becoming extinct

674
00:46:19,37 --> 00:46:23,31
one after another the great victorian
buildings began a process is shifting

675
00:46:23,31 --> 00:46:24,7
their patients Alma's

676
00:46:24,7 --> 00:46:31,7
into the community and shutting their
gates for ever

677
00:46:31,9 --> 00:46:35,46
incentive doing things piecemeal

678
00:46:35,46 --> 00:46:39,11
and things are old anyone rush it was
you know it

679
00:46:39,11 --> 00:46:43,54
Wakefield and decided to go in today
shack at the hospital's

680
00:46:43,54 --> 00:46:46,74
who dis be lived in the same
Wolverhampton Birmingham no love them

681
00:46:46,74 --> 00:46:48,61
are going to do the same to English
people

682
00:46:48,61 --> 00:46:55,61
with them so everybody went out into the
community this was the start of care in

683
00:46:56,73 --> 00:46:58,85
the community as we know it today

684
00:46:58,85 --> 00:47:04,43
the idea was that the majority of
patients be placed out in the community

685
00:47:04,43 --> 00:47:10,29
with psychiatric support

686
00:47:10,29 --> 00:47:14,98
an ITV film documented the closure have
one mental disability institution

687
00:47:14,98 --> 00:47:19,94
in Stockport under the new system there
would still be heads for some

688
00:47:19,94 --> 00:47:23,25
acute cases but for most patients

689
00:47:23,25 --> 00:47:28,23
it was the start a new life you thank
you very much for your

690
00:47:28,23 --> 00:47:31,46
everything you need to know was still
worth senator

691
00:47:31,46 --> 00:47:37,78
the gym I love champ

692
00:47:37,78 --> 00:47:43,38
who the trickle of people who've been
leaving hospital during the last decade

693
00:47:43,38 --> 00:47:50,38
is now a flood it's a revolution

694
00:47:51,24 --> 00:47:58,24
against institutional care the new rules
mean that everyone has the right to

695
00:47:58,48 --> 00:47:59,2
assay

696
00:47:59,2 --> 00:48:02,79
in their own future well

697
00:48:02,79 --> 00:48:09,79
freedom is government policy

698
00:48:11,32 --> 00:48:13,58
the songs were closed down one missus
thatcher

699
00:48:13,58 --> 00:48:17,54
she's a strange person to thank for an
active social justice

700
00:48:17,54 --> 00:48:21,88
but we have her to thank for around
emancipator yasser

701
00:48:21,88 --> 00:48:25,23
former psychiatric patients by closing
down our silence

702
00:48:25,23 --> 00:48:31,34
with the closure the signs came a new
spirit among patients

703
00:48:31,34 --> 00:48:34,92
as they begin to confront the realities
of life outside

704
00:48:34,92 --> 00:48:38,88
they found a new self-confidence it was
a chance to share

705
00:48:38,88 --> 00:48:44,24
in the individualism at the time no once
you actually stopped

706
00:48:44,24 --> 00:48:47,56
destroying people's lives by looking
them up destroying

707
00:48:47,56 --> 00:48:51,66
any kind individuality you actually did
it in the floodgates

708
00:48:51,66 --> 00:48:55,44
saying hang on this said people in
believe they are actually worth more

709
00:48:55,44 --> 00:48:56,14
than that

710
00:48:56,14 --> 00:49:01,54
omits the wreckage the Asylum's

711
00:49:01,54 --> 00:49:06,59
a grassroots movement sprang up in which
patients challenge doctors preeminent

712
00:49:06,59 --> 00:49:08,66
role in decisions about treatment

713
00:49:08,66 --> 00:49:13,07
the user movement

714
00:49:13,07 --> 00:49:17,21
as it was called campaign successfully
for patients to be more than the passive

715
00:49:17,21 --> 00:49:18,03
recipients

716
00:49:18,03 --> 00:49:25,03
of Psychiatry now we have a system that
people expect to be on want to be

717
00:49:25,47 --> 00:49:29,84
knowledgeable about their problems and
they want to be involved in assaults is

718
00:49:29,84 --> 00:49:36,84
treatments that doctors prescribed

719
00:49:37,27 --> 00:49:39,23
John Tuckwell who was first admitted

720
00:49:39,23 --> 00:49:42,859
into a mental hospital in 1953 because
of her panic attacks

721
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:48,24
was not released into the outside world
she had been in one asylum or another

722
00:49:48,24 --> 00:49:55,24
for a third of a century

723
00:49:58,06 --> 00:50:01,13
testing were being free free after

even their heads aerobatic magnetic

725
00:50:06,44 --> 00:50:11,119
really think that do things for yourself

726
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,25
Jones transition to the outside world
was filmed by her local health service

727
00:50:15,25 --> 00:50:21,2
to show the challenges of caring
community long-term patients had to get

728
00:50:21,2 --> 00:50:22,369
used to like amidst

729
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:25,5
decades-old Dame routines left behind

730
00:50:25,5 --> 00:50:28,88
the reality wasn't old gym had hoped for

731
00:50:28,88 --> 00:50:33,83
where they put me and it really shake I
had no probs

732
00:50:33,83 --> 00:50:37,17
tables and I I have varying

733
00:50:37,17 --> 00:50:41,23
happy I had that magical ethical can't

734
00:50:41,23 --> 00:50:45,13
I had nothing to for India free I had
their own money

735
00:50:45,13 --> 00:50:49,64
and they're waiting day and this hair
electorate hardly anything

736
00:50:49,64 --> 00:50:55,41
getting there

737
00:50:55,41 --> 00:50:59,599
like many other patients

738
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,32
Joan had to cope the certain amount of
stigma with the show to the silent gone

739
00:51:06,32 --> 00:51:10,95
old prejudices came to the surface who
when I

740
00:51:10,95 --> 00:51:14,47
supa are of battery for which mr. track

741
00:51:14,47 --> 00:51:18,49
they don't forget your window was and
get our share sites

742
00:51:18,49 --> 00:51:22,7
not now she as it was an American
history

743
00:51:22,7 --> 00:51:26,23
sometime people were sent to me

744
00:51:26,23 --> 00:51:31,79
why did you go back to brew law so I a
set of our secure you can never go back

745
00:51:31,79 --> 00:51:32,57
pay

746
00:51:32,57 --> 00:51:35,97
but john has survived

747
00:51:35,97 --> 00:51:40,
she's made a life for herself in the
community with the help of a camera

748
00:51:40, --> 00:51:45,7
and continued medication in another era

749
00:51:45,7 --> 00:51:49,72
she might have remained a long stay
bored in an asylum until she died

750
00:51:49,72 --> 00:51:53,99
like many others jim has found a degree

751
00:51:53,99 --> 00:51:59,76
freedom I filled with the optimism that
certain

752
00:51:59,76 --> 00:52:02,83
there was a future in the community for
people and

753
00:52:02,83 --> 00:52:07,58
term we could set so goals for ourselves
and we could achieve things and

754
00:52:07,58 --> 00:52:14,58
we could begin to take better control
over our lives

755
00:52:14,98 --> 00:52:19,35
but the euphoria was short-lived the
political honeymoon for care in the

756
00:52:19,35 --> 00:52:21,4
community was over very quickly

757
00:52:21,4 --> 00:52:25,85
December 1992 at Finsbury Park tube
station in London

758
00:52:25,85 --> 00:52:28,88
and recently released psychiatric
patient

759
00:52:28,88 --> 00:52:33,6
staff to passenger neon and killed

760
00:52:33,6 --> 00:52:36,65
it was the most notorious have several
disturbing incidents

761
00:52:36,65 --> 00:52:40,26
which Joe to the public's ideas about
the new forms care

762
00:52:40,26 --> 00:52:43,67
it sparked panic in many parts of
society

763
00:52:43,67 --> 00:52:48,59
hymns its 11 a.m. in a North London
police station

764
00:52:48,59 --> 00:52:52,23
officers are being briefed about a
potential killer not by a colleague

765
00:52:52,23 --> 00:52:56,66
but by the man psychiatrist and the
problem over the last three weeks has

766
00:52:56,66 --> 00:52:57,66
been increasing

767
00:52:57,66 --> 00:53:01,04
threats and violence in specific threats
if wanting to kill

followed to work as a consultant
psychiatrist in North London

771
00:53:10,72 --> 00:53:14,33
think he is at the moment up

772
00:53:14,33 --> 00:53:17,99
it was a vision of psychiatric services
that nobody involved in care in the

773
00:53:17,99 --> 00:53:18,69
community

774
00:53:18,69 --> 00:53:25,53
wanted to see roundup

775
00:53:25,53 --> 00:53:29,58
both psychiatrist am police judge
overwhelming force

776
00:53:29,58 --> 00:53:36,58
is necessary

777
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,049
releasing thousands have psychiatric
patients into society

778
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:47,23
raised a whole new set of problems what
seems to happen in the nineties

779
00:53:47,23 --> 00:53:53,2
is that people suddenly start to get
cold feet about it all in and start to

780
00:53:53,2 --> 00:53:56,97
fear that actually what this might mean
is that you call loads loads have

781
00:53:56,97 --> 00:54:00,9
have people with uncontrolled mental
illness running about society causing

782
00:54:00,9 --> 00:54:01,599
mayhem

783
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:08,599
K the newly elected Labour government
was clearly on the side of safety first

784
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:12,349
health secretary Frank Dobson openly
declared

785
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:18,16
community can had failed the political
response was ultimately restrictive

786
00:54:18,16 --> 00:54:19,41
legislation

787
00:54:19,41 --> 00:54:22,97
doctors were given powers to force
patients in the community to take

788
00:54:22,97 --> 00:54:23,98
medication

789
00:54:23,98 --> 00:54:27,92
or risk losing their newfound freedom
too many people

790
00:54:27,92 --> 00:54:31,98
it seems like a step backwards %uh

791
00:54:31,98 --> 00:54:38,98
0

792
00:54:40,74 --> 00:54:42,56
high Royds was finally closed

793
00:54:42,56 --> 00:54:48,18
in 2003 0 it was one of the last relic
so the asylum network

794
00:54:48,18 --> 00:54:51,77
unlike many others was bought by
developers to be turned into luxury

795
00:54:51,77 --> 00:54:52,57
flats

796
00:54:52,57 --> 00:54:56,14
them

797
00:54:56,14 --> 00:54:58,299
I felt it was passed its best by

798
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:05,299
it'd damage duty it it's your bitch cars

799
00:55:05,34 --> 00:55:11,41
but a.m. people like the change Haram
fortunate still need to be cared for

800
00:55:11,41 --> 00:55:14,65
0

801
00:55:14,65 --> 00:55:18,63
this place did indeed provide refuge
from the world for some patients

802
00:55:18,63 --> 00:55:23,74
asylum

803
00:55:23,74 --> 00:55:28,88
in the true sense some feel that this
idea

804
00:55:28,88 --> 00:55:33,13
protection rest has been lost 0

805
00:55:33,13 --> 00:55:35,81
that the community can never replace
this kind

806
00:55:35,81 --> 00:55:39,2
institution lower fee the use the

807
00:55:39,2 --> 00:55:42,61
the new local serb to Community Care

808
00:55:42,61 --> 00:55:46,69
is this also I do think

809
00:55:46,69 --> 00:55:53,69
real music is not on my persian

810
00:55:53,76 --> 00:55:58,49
the water I'm

811
00:55:58,49 --> 00:56:01,71
there even those who think that the
failure the Asylum's has been

812
00:56:01,71 --> 00:56:02,74
exaggerated

813
00:56:02,74 --> 00:56:07,89
I'm

814
00:56:07,89 --> 00:56:12,84
but few people have time for nostalgia
I'm

815
00:56:12,84 --> 00:56:17,03
I get very angry when I see people
glorifying the me know these lovelies

816
00:56:17,03 --> 00:56:19,76
states in beautiful victorian buildings
in the country

817
00:56:19,76 --> 00:56:23,17
they will of all places they were

818
00:56:23,17 --> 00:56:27,41
demeaning devaluing places I know

819
00:56:27,41 --> 00:56:30,93
no one who would love to go back to a
forty buddy Doomtree

820
00:56:30,93 --> 00:56:34,99
and that bad and then locker nadine's
Bible and the shared clients

821
00:56:34,99 --> 00:56:38,27
the

822
00:56:38,27 --> 00:56:43,99
on Britain's asylums are now closed
forever

823
00:56:43,99 --> 00:56:49,17
these were once extraordinary places
home to more than 250,000 people

824
00:56:49,17 --> 00:56:52,65
at the height but they had

825
00:56:52,65 --> 00:56:57,34
outlive the ideals of the Victorian
architect and too often had become

826
00:56:57,34 --> 00:57:00,45
dustbins humanity

827
00:57:00,45 --> 00:57:03,869
but leave behind the lives they
transformed

828
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:06,97
Abdul realize that although I was

829
00:57:06,97 --> 00:57:11,13
in the system five years which seems an
awful in long time

830
00:57:11,13 --> 00:57:16,23
a funnel the patient's five years can
turn into fifty sixty years or whatever

831
00:57:16,23 --> 00:57:19,57
in that sense I can see that I was one
of the lucky ones

832
00:57:19,57 --> 00:57:22,599
